# Quiz App
**This README.md was generated by chatGPT**

This is a simple quiz application written in Rust. It reads quiz questions and options from a JSON file, presents the questions to the user one by one, and checks the user's answers.

## Prerequisites
- Rust programming language installed. If not, you can [install Rust here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/lycantrope/qa_cli)
   cd qa_cli
   ```

2. Build and run the application:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to answer the quiz questions.

## How it works
- The application reads quiz questions and options from a JSON file (`questions.json`), deserializes the JSON data, and presents the questions to the user one by one.
- For each question, the user selects an answer by entering the corresponding number (1 to N) for the options provided.
- After answering a question, the application indicates whether the answer is correct or not.
- If the answer is incorrect, the user has the option to retry the question.

## JSON Data Format
The `questions.json` file should have the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "prompt": "Question prompt here",
    "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],
    "ans": 2
  },
  // Additional questions...
]
```

- `"prompt"`: The question prompt.
- `"options"`: An array of options for the question.
- `"ans"`: The index of the correct answer in the options array (1-based index).

## Dependencies
- [itertools](https://crates.io/crates/itertools): Provides utility functions for working with iterators.
- [promptly](https://crates.io/crates/promptly): A library for user input handling.
- [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde): A popular serialization and deserialization library for Rust.
